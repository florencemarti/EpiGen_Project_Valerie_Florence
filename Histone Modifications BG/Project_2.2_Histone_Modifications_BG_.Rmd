# Importing the downloaded data
In this part I imported the peaks for the histone modifications H3K4me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac for monocytes (M0), macrophages (mf), and beta-glucan primed macrophages (BG). Additionally I imported the list of human TF's that play a role in macrophage polarisation.


```{r}
# Example peakfiles vector (adjust paths):
peakfiles_M0 <- list.files("peaks", pattern = "\\M0.bed$", full.names = TRUE)
names(peakfiles) <- gsub("\\.bed$", "", basename(peakfiles))

peakfiles
# Import peaks:
peaks <- lapply(peakfiles, rtracklayer::import, format="BED")
```
